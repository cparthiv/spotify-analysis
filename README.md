# Spotify Music Played Analysis

Heavily inspired by [jayeshironside](https://github.com/jayeshironside/Spotify-Streaming-history-analysis/blob/main/README.md) but I create a lot of new visual displays.

In this repository, I analyze and visualize my user data from Spotify to create beautiful visualizations, available [here](https://www.parthiv.dev/blog/spotify-visualizations) and [./visualizations](https://github.com/cparthiv/spotify-analysis/tree/main/visualizations)

I am not uploading my data publicly because it contains sensitive information like my user agent, but you're welcome to clone the repo and upload your data for usage.
